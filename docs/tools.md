## Search and records

<img src="assets/icon-search.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="" align="left"> Guide: [search](search.md)<br clear="left">

### `search_scopus`

Search for documents in Scopus using a query string.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | string | required | The Scopus search query (e.g., 'TITLE(AI) AND PUBYEAR > 2020'). |
| `count` | integer | 5 | Number of results to return (default 5, max 25). |
| `sort` | string | coverDate | Sort order (e.g., 'coverDate', 'relevancy'). |

### `search_all` · **OpenAlex**

Search Scopus (or OpenAlex with source='openalex') and page through results automatically, returning up to max_results entries in one call. Scopus pages hold SCOPUS_PAGE_SIZE records (default 25) and switch to cursor paging beyond 5,000; OpenAlex pages hold 200. Results over 50 records are written to disk as JSON and CSV. Large max_results values consume significant quota — use conservatively. With source='openalex', topics keeps papers about OpenAlex topics, subfields or fields (default record types: articles, reviews, books, book chapters); one extra request resolves each name, and a scope of more than 50 journals runs one request chain per 50.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | string | required | Search query. Scopus: Scopus syntax (e.g., 'TITLE(AI) AND PUBYEAR > 2020'). OpenAlex: plain words matched against title and abstract; quote phrases (e.g., '"organizing vision"'). |
| `max_results` | integer | 200 | Maximum total results to fetch across all pages (default 200). Large values consume quota. |
| `sort` | string |  | Sort order (e.g., 'coverDate', 'relevancy', 'citedby'). Defaults to 'coverDate' for Scopus, 'relevance' for OpenAlex. |
| `scope` |  |  | Restrict to journals, by ISSN: a list of ISSNs, or a basket name ('basket_of_eight' / 'ais8': the AIS Senior Scholars' Basket of Eight). ISSNs are used rather than journal names, which Scopus spells inconsistently. |
| `topics` | list of string |  | OpenAlex only. Keep papers about these topics, subfields or fields: topic IDs ('T10346'), 'subfield:1710' or 'field:17' (or 'subfields/1710', 'fields/17'), or exact names ('Digital Transformation'). Several entries combine as OR, all at one level. A name that matches more than one entity, or none exactly, is refused with the candidates listed. Each name costs one extra request (the 26 fields and 252 subfields are fetched once and cached). Combines with scope and quality as AND. Not available with source='scopus'. |
| `topic_match` | `primary` \| `any` | primary | 'primary' (default) matches the one topic OpenAlex ranks first for a paper: a tighter corpus. 'any' matches a paper when any of its assigned topics (up to three) is in the scope: wider, and it catches papers that sit between fields. |
| `work_types` |  |  | With topics: the OpenAlex record types to keep. Default ['article', 'review', 'book', 'book-chapter'], which leaves out datasets, specimens, proposals and other records that now receive topics. 'all' keeps every type. |
| `inline` | `sample` \| `compact` \| `full` | sample | What comes back in the reply when results go to files (over 50 records). 'sample' (default): the first 10. 'compact': every record as one JSON line of key fields (IDs, DOI, year, first author, title, venue, ISSN, citations): use it when the caller cannot read the server's files, e.g. from a cloud session. 'full': every record in full (large). |

### `search_fulltext`

Search the full text of Elsevier (ScienceDirect) journal articles, not just titles and abstracts: finds papers that use a construct in their body without naming it up front. Needs Scopus/ScienceDirect subscriber access; covers Elsevier-published content only. With context=true, the top results' full texts are retrieved to count mentions in the body (separately from the reference list), give their positions through the article, and quote example sentences: how a paper uses the construct, not just that it does. Up to 1000 results; over 50 are written to JSON and CSV.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | string | required | ScienceDirect query; quote phrases, e.g. '"organizing vision"'. AND, OR, NOT allowed. |
| `journal` | string |  | Restrict to a journal title, e.g. 'Information and Organization'. |
| `from_year` | integer |  | First publication year. |
| `to_year` | integer |  | Last publication year. |
| `open_access_only` | boolean | False |  |
| `max_results` | integer | 100 | Results to fetch (default 100, max 1000). |
| `sort` | `relevance` \| `date` | relevance |  |
| `context` | boolean | False | Analyse mentions in the top results' full texts. |
| `max_context` | integer | 10 | Articles to analyse when context=true (default 10, max 25); one full-text request each. |

### `get_abstract_details`

Retrieve full details for a specific document by Scopus ID.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scopus_id` | string | required | The Scopus ID of the document. |

### `resolve_identifier`

Resolve any document identifier (Scopus ID, EID, DOI, or PII) to the full cross-reference set (scopus_id, eid, doi, pii, title). Use this to obtain a DOI for cross-linking with OpenAlex/Crossref, or to normalize an ID before calling other tools.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `identifier` | string | required | The identifier value (e.g. '0031512927', '2-s2.0-0031512927', or a DOI). |
| `id_type` | `scopus_id` \| `eid` \| `doi` \| `pii` |  | Optional override of the identifier type. |

### `search_authors` · **OpenAlex**

Find authors by name, optionally narrowed by affiliation. Scopus (default, needs subscriber entitlement): author IDs for get_author_profile, document counts, current affiliation, subject areas and name variants, ranked by document count. OpenAlex: OpenAlex author IDs, ORCID, works and citation counts, h-index, institution and topics. Common surnames need an affiliation or given name to be useful.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | required | 'Surname, Given names' or 'Given names Surname', e.g. 'Swanson, E. Burton'. |
| `affiliation` | string |  | Optional affiliation words to narrow the match, e.g. 'Los Angeles'. |
| `count` | integer | 10 | Number of authors to return (default 10, max 25). |

### `get_author_profile`

Retrieve an author's profile by Author ID.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `author_id` | string | required | The Scopus Author ID. |

### `get_fulltext`

Retrieve the full text of a paper via a provider waterfall: (1) ScienceDirect full text (requires SCOPUS_INSTTOKEN or institutional IP), (2) open-access copy: every open location in OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar's open PDF and arXiv ID, arXiv by exact title, Europe PMC, and Unpaywall or CORE when configured; published versions first, and the result names the source and version (preprint, accepted manuscript, published), (3) Scopus abstract fallback. Returns provenance, character count, file path, and a ~1500-char sample. Full body is written to disk — never returned inline. ToS note: retrieval is for the user's own non-commercial text-and-data-mining; content written to local disk must not be redistributed.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `doi` | string | required | The DOI of the paper (e.g. '10.1016/j.infoandorg.2026.100608'). |
| `prefer` | `sciencedirect` \| `oa` \| `abstract` |  | Skip straight to a tier for testing: 'sciencedirect', 'oa', 'abstract'. |

## Citations

### `get_references` · **OpenAlex**

Retrieve the cited-reference list of a document (Backward Citations) via the Abstract Retrieval REF view. Complements get_citing_papers, which returns forward citations. Scopus requires an entitled (subscriber) key; source='openalex' does not.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scopus_id` | string | required | The Scopus ID (or EID) of the document whose references to retrieve. With source='openalex', a DOI or OpenAlex work ID also works. |
| `count` | integer | 25 | Maximum number of references to return (default 25). The reply always states how many the document has, and whether the list was cut. |
| `filter_ids` | list of string |  | Return only references whose Scopus ID, EID, DOI (or, with source='openalex', OpenAlex ID) is in this list: the within-set edges of a corpus without the full reference records. count does not apply. |
| `check_completeness` | boolean | False | Compare the retrieved list with the reference count the publisher deposited at Crossref, and flag lists that look short (default false; one Crossref request). |

### `get_citing_papers` · **OpenAlex**

Retrieve a list of papers that have cited the specified document (Forward Citations).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scopus_id` | string | required | The Scopus ID of the document to find citations for. With source='openalex', a DOI or OpenAlex work ID also works. |
| `count` | integer | 5 | Number of results to return (default 5, max 25). |
| `sort` | string | coverDate | Sort order (e.g., 'coverDate', 'relevancy'). |

## Networks and lineage

<img src="assets/icon-networks.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="" align="left"> Guide: [networks](networks.md)<br clear="left">

### `bibliographic_coupling` · **OpenAlex**

Build a bibliographic-coupling graph for a set of seed papers. Two seeds are coupled when they share cited references; edge weight = count of shared references, cosine = Salton index. Maps the current research front. Scopus needs an entitled (subscriber) key for REF-view access; source='openalex' does not. Output: GraphML + CSV edge list written to disk.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `seed_ids` | list of string | required | Seed papers: Scopus IDs (bare numeric or SCOPUS_ID: prefixed). With source='openalex', DOIs and OpenAlex work IDs also work. |
| `min_shared` | integer | 2 | Minimum shared references for an edge to be emitted (default 2). |

### `co_citation` · **OpenAlex**

Build a co-citation graph for a set of seed papers. Two seeds are co-cited when a later paper cites both; edge weight = count of co-citing papers, cosine = Salton index. Maps the intellectual base of a field. max_citing_per_seed bounds the API quota used per seed. Output: GraphML + CSV edge list written to disk.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `seed_ids` | list of string | required | Seed papers: Scopus IDs (bare numeric or SCOPUS_ID: prefixed). With source='openalex', DOIs and OpenAlex work IDs also work. |
| `min_shared` | integer | 2 | Minimum co-citing papers for an edge to be emitted (default 2). |
| `max_citing_per_seed` | integer | 500 | Cap on citing papers fetched per seed (default 500). Limits quota usage. |

### `citation_lineage` · **OpenAlex**

Walk the citation lineage of a seed paper across multiple generations. Forward: generation 1 = papers that cite the seed; generation 2 = papers that cite those; up to 3 generations. Backward: walks cited references. All papers are deduplicated globally. Output: corpus written to disk as JSON plus compact inline summary; the corpus is also returned inline as base64 so sandboxed callers can inspect it. Use sort='citedby' (default for forward) to collect the most-cited citers first, which gives a meaningful citation-backbone; sort='coverDate' collects the most recent citers first (which can produce a recency-dominated walk). source='openalex' walks OpenAlex instead (no Scopus entitlement; node IDs are OpenAlex work IDs; reference lists are thinner and absent for AIS eLibrary papers). Server version is included in every response.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `seed_id` | string | required | Scopus ID or EID of the seed paper. With source='openalex', a DOI or OpenAlex work ID also works. |
| `generations` | integer | 1 | Number of generations to walk (default 1, max 3). |
| `max_per_node` | integer | 200 | Cap on citing papers fetched per paper per generation (default 200). |
| `min_citing` | integer | 0 | Only expand papers that have at least this many citing papers (default 0 = expand all up to max_per_node). Pruning high values avoids exploding on trivially-cited nodes. Ignored for backward direction. |
| `direction` | `forward` \| `backward` | forward | 'forward' (default): walk citing papers via search_all + REF(). Fan-out can be large; use max_per_node to bound quota. 'backward': walk cited references via get_references, up to max_per_node per paper; references with no ID are skipped. |
| `sort` | `citedby` \| `coverDate` \| `relevancy` | citedby | How to rank citing papers before the max_per_node cap is applied (forward direction only; ignored for backward). 'citedby' (default): highest citation count first — captures the high-flow backbone. 'coverDate': most recent first — captures the current fringe but may produce a recency-dominated walk on high-citation seeds. 'relevancy': Scopus relevance score (Scopus only). |
| `scope` |  |  | Forward walks only: keep citing papers from these journals (ISSN list, or 'basket_of_eight'/'ais8'). The filter goes into the search, so max_per_node counts in-scope papers only. Restrict to journals, by ISSN: a list of ISSNs, or a basket name ('basket_of_eight' / 'ais8': the AIS Senior Scholars' Basket of Eight). ISSNs are used rather than journal names, which Scopus spells inconsistently. |

### `citation_network` · **OpenAlex**

Direct-citation network within a set of papers, in one call: fetches every paper's reference list, keeps only the references to other papers in the set, and runs main-path analysis (SPC weights, local and global main path, key routes). Give ids (Scopus IDs/EIDs; with source='openalex', DOIs or OpenAlex IDs) or a query. Completeness: each list is compared with an independent reference count (Crossref, else OpenAlex, else Semantic Scholar; the source is reported per paper); short = fewer than 90% of the comparison count and at least 5 references missing (SCOPUS_COMPLETENESS_RATIO, SCOPUS_COMPLETENESS_MIN_MISSING). Papers whose references could not be loaded or parsed are listed, retried once after rate limits, and the main path is marked provisional while any are missing. Likely duplicate records are listed. Writes JSON, Pajek .net (arcs from cited to citing, SPC weights; Pajek, VOSviewer, Gephi) and an edge CSV. Cost: one reference request per paper (cached). Sets over about 50 papers may return a job ID: poll job_status, then job_result.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ids` | list of string |  | The papers (up to 1000). Use this or query. |
| `query` | string |  | Search query defining the set, instead of ids. |
| `max_results` | integer | 300 | With query: how many papers to include (default 300). |
| `corpus_file` | string |  | A corpus file from import_records, instead of ids or query. |
| `scope` |  |  | Restrict to journals, by ISSN: a list of ISSNs, or a basket name ('basket_of_eight' / 'ais8': the AIS Senior Scholars' Basket of Eight). ISSNs are used rather than journal names, which Scopus spells inconsistently. |
| `topics` | list of string |  | OpenAlex only. Keep papers about these topics, subfields or fields: topic IDs ('T10346'), 'subfield:1710' or 'field:17' (or 'subfields/1710', 'fields/17'), or exact names ('Digital Transformation'). Several entries combine as OR, all at one level. A name that matches more than one entity, or none exactly, is refused with the candidates listed. Each name costs one extra request (the 26 fields and 252 subfields are fetched once and cached). Combines with scope and quality as AND. Not available with source='scopus'. |
| `topic_match` | `primary` \| `any` | primary | 'primary' (default) matches the one topic OpenAlex ranks first for a paper: a tighter corpus. 'any' matches a paper when any of its assigned topics (up to three) is in the scope: wider, and it catches papers that sit between fields. |
| `work_types` |  |  | With topics: the OpenAlex record types to keep. Default ['article', 'review', 'book', 'book-chapter'], which leaves out datasets, specimens, proposals and other records that now receive topics. 'all' keeps every type. |
| `key_routes` | integer | 10 | Number of top-SPC key edges to extend into key-route main paths (Liu & Lu 2012; default 10, 0 = none). Key edges that extend into the same route are merged. |
| `check_completeness` | boolean | True | Compare each reference list with an independent count (default true). |
| `weight` | `spc` \| `splc` \| `spnp` | spc | Traversal weight for the main paths and key routes: 'spc' (search path count, source-to-sink paths), 'splc' (search path link count: paths starting at any paper), 'spnp' (search path node pair: paths between any two papers). Liu & Lu 2012. |
| `key_route_search` | `local` \| `global` | local | How key edges are extended: 'local' follows the heaviest adjoining edge; 'global' takes the heaviest whole path to and from the key edge. |
| `check_retractions` | boolean | True | Flag retracted, withdrawn or concern-flagged papers (Crossref / Retraction Watch; default true). |
| `edge_contexts` | boolean | False | Also gather citation contexts for every edge (Semantic Scholar; one request per citing paper, cached), give each a draft transmission label, and write a coding sheet for two coders. Slow without a Semantic Scholar key; runs as a job past the sync budget. |
| `construct_terms` | list of string |  | With edge_contexts: the construct for the draft labels, e.g. ['organizing vision']. |
| `max_context_edges` | integer | 300 | With edge_contexts: most edges to examine, heaviest SPC first (default 300). |
| `robustness` | boolean | True | Also compute the global main path under all three weights and report the papers they share: a path that survives a change of weight is a finding, one that does not is partly an artefact of the weight. |
| `inline` | `summary` \| `edges` \| `nodes` \| `full` | edges | What the reply carries besides the file paths. 'summary': counts, flags and paths. 'edges' (default): also every edge as a compact line (up to 2,000). 'nodes': one compact line per paper (ID, author year, venue, references retrieved/reported, comparison count and source, completeness, error) plus the edges: node-level data for callers that cannot read the server's files, about 25k characters for 150 papers. 'full': the corpus as JSON, paged by page/page_size nodes. |
| `page` | integer | 1 | With inline='full': which page of nodes (1-based). |
| `page_size` | integer | 50 | With inline='full': nodes per page (default 50). |

### `historiograph` · **OpenAlex**

Garfield's historiograph: the papers most cited within the set (local citation score) on a time axis, with the citations among them and the global main path highlighted. Complements the main path with the picture readers expect beside it. Give ids or a query. Writes a PNG and a Pajek file; lists the papers with their local and global citation counts.

Several entries combine as OR, all at one level. A name that matches more than one entity, or none exactly, is refused with the candidates listed. Each name costs one extra request (the 26 fields and 252 subfields are fetched once and cached). Combines with scope and quality as AND. Not available with source='scopus'. |
| `topic_match` | `primary` \| `any` | primary | 'primary' (default) matches the one topic OpenAlex ranks first for a paper: a tighter corpus. 'any' matches a paper when any of its assigned topics (up to three) is in the scope: wider, and it catches papers that sit between fields. |
| `work_types` |  |  | With topics: the OpenAlex record types to keep. Default ['article', 'review', 'book', 'book-chapter'], which leaves out datasets, specimens, proposals and other records that now receive topics. 'all' keeps every type. |
| `top` | integer | 30 | Papers to draw, by local citation score (default 30). |

### `rpys` · **OpenAlex**

Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (Marx et al. 2014): counts every cited reference of a set of papers by the year the cited work appeared, subtracts the five-year median, and reports the peak years with the works cited most from each: the set's historical roots. Give ids or a query (e.g. the confirmed citers from resolve_citers). Writes a CSV of the spectrogram and a PNG. Cost: one reference request per paper (cached; shared with citation_network). With source='openalex' the cited works are fetched in batches of 50.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ids` | list of string |  | The papers (Scopus IDs/EIDs; with source='openalex', DOIs or OpenAlex IDs). Use this or query. |

### `research_fronts` · **OpenAlex**

Research fronts of a paper set: Louvain communities of its direct-citation network (as in CitNetExplorer), each described by its years, density, core papers (most cited within the set) and the keywords that distinguish it. Also reports which front each paper of the global main path belongs to and where the path hops from one front to another: a main path that stays in one front traces a single conversation, one that hops stitches several together. Give ids or a query. Writes JSON and Pajek .net plus .clu (partition) files. Cost: one reference and one abstract request per paper (cached).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Audit

<img src="assets/icon-audit.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="" align="left"> Guide: [audit](audit.md)<br clear="left">

### `resolve_citers` · **OpenAlex**

All papers citing one or more seed papers, found by several search strategies at once and verified. Runs REF() on each seed plus any extra queries (for example a title-phrase query), merges the hits, then checks each hit's own reference list for the seeds. Reports a per-strategy table (hits, confirmed, unconfirmed, verification failed, confirmed citers the strategy missed). With cross_check (default on when scope is given) it also asks OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar which in-scope papers cite the seeds and lists those Scopus misses or cannot confirm, with Scopus's reference count against the external one, so truncated Scopus reference lists become visible. The Scopus result stays Scopus-only. Long runs may return a job ID: poll job_status, then job_result.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `seed_ids` | list of string | required | Seed papers (Scopus IDs/EIDs; with source='openalex', DOIs or OpenAlex IDs), e.g. both papers of a construct's origin. |
| `queries` | list of string |  | Extra search strategies, e.g. REF("organizing vision") or REFAUTH(swanson) AND REFTITLE("organizing vision"). |
| `scope` |  |  | Restrict to journals, by ISSN: a list of ISSNs, or a basket name ('basket_of_eight' / 'ais8': the AIS Senior Scholars' Basket of Eight). ISSNs are used rather than journal names, which Scopus spells inconsistently. |
| `verify` | boolean | True | Check each hit's reference list for the seeds (default true). |
| `cross_check` | boolean |  | Scopus only: list in-scope citers that OpenAlex or Semantic Scholar know and Scopus misses (default: on when scope is set). |
| `max_results` | integer | 1000 | Cap on hits per strategy (default 1000). |
| `inline` | `summary` \| `compact` | compact | 'compact' (default): every hit as one JSON line (ID, DOI, year, title, status, seeds found in its references, strategies). 'summary': counts only. |

### `citation_context`

How one paper cites another: the citing sentences, the citation intent (background, methodology, result) and whether Semantic Scholar classes the citation as influential. Evidence for whether a citation edge carries the cited idea or is a passing mention. Up to 50 pairs per call; IDs are DOIs, Scopus IDs or OpenAlex IDs, resolved to Semantic Scholar by DOI, MAG ID, then title and year (the route is reported). Statuses: found, contexts_withheld (the citation is known, its sentences are not), edge_absent_in_s2, citing_paper_unresolved, cited_paper_unresolved. Contexts are cleaned of page headers and citation-free noise and ranked, most informative first. Where Semantic Scholar has no usable sentences, the citing paper's full text is searched instead (context_source: semantic_scholar, fulltext_sciencedirect, fulltext_oa or none).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `citing` | string |  | The citing paper (single pair). |
| `cited` | string |  | The cited paper (single pair). |
| `pairs` | list of object |  | Several [citing, cited] pairs, instead of citing/cited. |
| `max_contexts` | integer | 3 | Most contexts returned per pair (default 3). |
| `construct_terms` | list of string |  | Terms that make a context more informative, e.g. ['organizing vision']. |
| `fulltext_fallback` | boolean | True | When Semantic Scholar has no usable sentences, fetch the citing paper's full text (ScienceDirect, then open access), find the cited work in its reference list and return the sentences that cite it. |

### `path_transmission`

Transmission audit of a main path: for each consecutive edge (later paper citing the earlier one) it gathers the citing sentences (Semantic Scholar, then the citing paper's full text), Semantic Scholar's intent and influential flags, how many contexts name the construct terms, and whether the citation sits in a list of three or more works. Proposes a draft label per edge (substantive, construct-shifted, hollow, unresolved) with its evidence, and writes a CSV coding sheet with blank columns for two independent coders. Draft labels are heuristics for a human coder to confirm or overturn, not findings: substantive = the citing paper engages the cited work (influential, method/result intent, or two or more non-list contexts) and a context names a construct term in the cited work's own clause; construct-shifted = engages it without naming the construct; hollow = only background or list citations; unresolved = no context sentences from any source.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `path_ids` | list of string | required | The main path, oldest first (as citation_network reports it): Scopus IDs, DOIs or OpenAlex IDs. |
| `construct_terms` | list of string | required | The construct and its variants, e.g. ['organizing vision']. |
| `corpus_json` | string |  | Optional citation_network corpus file, to add each edge's SPC weight. |
| `max_contexts` | integer | 5 | Most contexts kept per edge (default 5). |

### `coding_agreement`

Inter-coder agreement on a coding sheet from path_transmission (or citation_network with edge_contexts) once two coders have filled their columns: Cohen's kappa with a 95% interval and its Landis & Koch reading, agreement per label, the confusion matrix and the disagreeing edges. Also scores the draft labels against each coder and against the coders' consensus, i.e. how far the heuristic can be trusted. Reads .csv (comma, semicolon or tab), as saved from Excel.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string | required | The filled coding sheet (.csv). |
| `coder_columns` | list of string |  | The two coder columns (default coder_1_label, coder_2_label). |
| `reference_column` | string | draft_label | Labels to validate against the coders (default draft_label; '' for none). |

### `index_coverage`

Which papers cite the seeds according to Scopus, OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar, under the same journal scope, and how the three sets overlap. Papers are matched by DOI, else by title and year. Makes index coverage a reported property of a study rather than a hidden one. Scopus side: REF() search (not verified; use resolve_citers for that).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `seed_ids` | list of string | required | Seed papers (Scopus IDs or EIDs). |
| `scope` |  |  | Restrict to journals, by ISSN: a list of ISSNs, or a basket name ('basket_of_eight' / 'ais8': the AIS Senior Scholars' Basket of Eight). ISSNs are used rather than journal names, which Scopus spells inconsistently. |
| `max_results` | integer | 1000 | Cap per index and seed (default 1000). |

### `check_retractions`

Retractions, withdrawals, expressions of concern and corrections for a set of papers, from Crossref (which carries the Retraction Watch database). Give DOIs, Scopus IDs, or a corpus_file from import_records. citation_network runs the same check on every network by default.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dois` | list of string |  |  |
| `ids` | list of string |  | Scopus IDs or EIDs. |
| `corpus_file` | string |  | A corpus file from import_records. |

### `publication_counts` · **OpenAlex**

Count publications per year for a query, e.g. to chart how attention to a topic rose and fell. Scopus: your query in Scopus syntax, one request per year, so from_year and to_year are required (at most 60 years). OpenAlex: plain words matched against title and abstract (quote phrases), one request for all years. The two sources count differently; compare trends within one source, not levels across sources. With source='openalex', topics restricts the count to OpenAlex topics, subfields or fields (one extra request per name to resolve it).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | string | required | Scopus: Scopus syntax, e.g. 'TITLE-ABS-KEY("organizing vision")'. OpenAlex: e.g. '"organizing vision"'. |
| `from_year` | integer |  | First year (inclusive). |
| `to_year` | integer |  | Last year (inclusive). |
| `topics` | list of string |  | OpenAlex only. Keep papers about these topics, subfields or fields: topic IDs ('T10346'), 'subfield:1710' or 'field:17' (or 'subfields/1710', 'fields/17'), or exact names ('Digital Transformation'). Several entries combine as OR, all at one level. A name that matches more than one entity, or none exactly, is refused with the candidates listed. Each name costs one extra request (the 26 fields and 252 subfields are fetched once and cached). Combines with scope and quality as AND. Not available with source='scopus'. |
| `topic_match` | `primary` \| `any` | primary | 'primary' (default) matches the one topic OpenAlex ranks first for a paper: a tighter corpus. 'any' matches a paper when any of its assigned topics (up to three) is in the scope: wider, and it catches papers that sit between fields. |
| `work_types` |  |  | With topics: the OpenAlex record types to keep. Default ['article', 'review', 'book', 'book-chapter'], which leaves out datasets, specimens, proposals and other records that now receive topics. 'all' keeps every type. |

### `topic_landscape`

Where and at what prestige a topic is published. Runs a Scopus query and reports (1) papers per broad subject area over all results, and (2) per subject category, how many papers appear in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 journals of that category, with the main journals. A journal can be Q1 in one category and Q3 in another, so each paper counts in every category of its journal. By default quartiles count journal papers only: proceedings series such as IFAC-PapersOnLine or Procedia CIRP also carry CiteScore ranks, and are reported separately with book series, together with the overall mix of venue types. Large topics are analysed on a sample of max_papers papers (up to 2000): most recent by default, or most cited to see where influential work appears; coverage is stated. Needs Scopus search entitlement.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | string | required | Scopus query, e.g. 'TITLE-ABS-KEY("organizing vision")'. |
| `from_year` | integer |  | First publication year. |
| `to_year` | integer |  | Last publication year. |
| `max_papers` | integer | 500 | Papers to analyse by quartile (default 500, max 2000). |
| `top_categories` | integer | 15 | Categories to report, largest first. |
| `sample` | `recent` \| `cited` \| `relevance` | recent | Which papers to analyse when the topic has more than max_papers: most recent, most cited (where influential work appears), or most relevant. |
| `journals_only` | boolean | True | Count only journal papers in the quartiles; ranked conference proceedings and book series are reported separately. False counts every ranked venue. |

### `thematic_evolution` · **OpenAlex**

Themes of a corpus and how they change over time (Cobo et al. 2011; as in bibliometrix's thematic map and thematic evolution). Per period: keyword co-occurrence clusters, each placed in the strategic diagram by Callon centrality and density (motor, basic, niche, emerging or declining); between periods: which themes continue, split, merge, appear or vanish (inclusion index). With construct_terms it follows a construct through the periods: the theme that holds it, where that theme sits, and the keywords it keeps company with, i.e. whether the construct stays central, drifts or dissolves into another. Give ids or a query. Writes JSON, CSV and a PNG of the strategic diagrams. Cost: one abstract request per paper (cached).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ids` | list of string |  | The papers (Scopus IDs/EIDs; with source='openalex', DOIs or OpenAlex IDs). Use this or query. |
| `query` | string |  | Search query defining the set, instead of ids. |
| `corpus_file` | string |  | A corpus file from import_records, instead of ids or query. |
| `max_results` | integer | 300 | With query: how many papers to include (default 300). |
| `scope` |  |  | Restrict to journals, by ISSN: a list of ISSNs, or a basket name ('basket_of_eight' / 'ais8': the AIS Senior Scholars' Basket of Eight). ISSNs are used rather than journal names, which Scopus spells inconsistently. |
| `topics` | list of string |  | OpenAlex only. Keep papers about these topics, subfields or fields: topic IDs ('T10346'), 'subfield:1710' or 'field:17' (or 'subfields/1710', 'fields/17'), or exact names ('Digital Transformation'). Several entries combine as OR, all at one level. A name that matches more than one entity, or none exactly, is refused with the candidates listed. Each name costs one extra request (the 26 fields and 252 subfields are fetched once and cached). Combines with scope and quality as AND. Not available with source='scopus'. |
| `topic_match` | `primary` \| `any` | primary | 'primary' (default) matches the one topic OpenAlex ranks first for a paper: a tighter corpus. 'any' matches a paper when any of its assigned topics (up to three) is in the scope: wider, and it catches papers that sit between fields. |
| `work_types` |  |  | With topics: the OpenAlex record types to keep. Default ['article', 'review', 'book', 'book-chapter'], which leaves out datasets, specimens, proposals and other records that now receive topics. 'all' keeps every type. |
| `cut_years` | list of integer |  | First years of the later periods, e.g. [2005, 2012] gives up to 2004, 2005-2011 and 2012 on. Default: n_periods of similar size. |
| `n_periods` | integer | 3 | Periods of similar paper counts when cut_years is not given (default 3). |
| `terms` | `author_keywords` \| `all_keywords` \| `title_abstract` | author_keywords | 'author_keywords' (default; papers without them fall back to Scopus index terms), 'all_keywords' (author keywords plus index terms), 'title_abstract' (phrases from title and abstract; for corpora with few keywords). With source='openalex', keywords are OpenAlex's own. |
| `construct_terms` | list of string |  | A construct to follow, e.g. ['organizing vision']. |
| `min_freq` | integer | 2 | Keywords must appear in at least this many papers of a period (default 2). |

### `get_journal_metrics` · **OpenAlex**

Journal metrics for a list of journals, e.g. a litbaskets basket. Scopus (default): SJR, SNIP, CiteScore and CiteScore Tracker with their years, plus subject areas, from the Serial Title API. Give ISSNs, or Scopus source IDs (SRCIDs), which are mapped to ISSNs through one Scopus search each (needs search entitlement). source='openalex': OpenAlex's own measures (2-year mean citedness, h-index, i10-index), ISSNs only, no entitlement. Journals not found are listed, never dropped. Also written to CSV. At most 200 journals per call.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `issns` | list of string |  | ISSNs, with or without hyphen. |
| `source_ids` | list of string |  | Scopus source IDs (SRCID), Scopus only. |

### `find_journals`

List the journals in one or more Scopus subject categories at or above a CiteScore percentile within that category: the quality cut-off for scoping a literature review (Q1 = 75, top 10% = 90). Categories are ASJC names or codes, e.g. 'Information Systems' (1710), 'Management Information Systems' (1404); ambiguous names return the candidates. Returns each journal's rank, percentile, quartile and CiteScore, a CSV, and ready-to-use Scopus query fragments SRCID(...) for search_all. Percentiles are from the latest complete CiteScore year.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `categories` | list of string | required | ASJC category names or 4-digit codes. |
| `min_percentile` | integer | 75 | Keep journals at or above this percentile in the category (75 = Q1, 90 = top 10%). |
| `journals_only` | boolean | True | Exclude book series, conference proceedings and trade journals. |

### `get_bibtex`

BibTeX entries for a list of papers, written to a .bib file and returned inline. Identifiers may be DOIs, Scopus IDs/EIDs or OpenAlex work IDs. Entries come from the publisher's metadata via DOI content negotiation (errors included, so check author names). Papers without a DOI, such as AIS conference papers, get a minimal entry built from Scopus or OpenAlex metadata, marked with a note. At most 200 identifiers per call.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `identifiers` | list of string | required | DOIs, Scopus IDs/EIDs, or OpenAlex work IDs (W...). |

### `import_records`

Read saved bibliographic exports into one deduplicated corpus file: Scopus CSV, RIS or BibTeX exports and Web of Science plain-text or tab-delimited exports (format detected). Records are merged across files by Scopus ID, WoS ID, DOI, or title and year. With resolve (default true), records without a Scopus ID (e.g. from Web of Science) are matched in Scopus by DOI, then by exact title and year. Returns the corpus file path and the Scopus IDs. Pass the file as corpus_file to citation_network, rpys, historiograph, research_fronts or thematic_evolution to analyse exactly these records again later (thematic_evolution then reads keywords from the file, with no API calls).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `paths` | list of string | required | Export files on this computer (.csv, .txt, .ris, .bib, .tsv). |
| `resolve` | boolean | True | Look up Scopus IDs for records without one (default true). |

## Diagnostics and jobs

<img src="assets/icon-diagnostics.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="" align="left"> Guide: [access](access.md)<br clear="left">

### `diagnose_connection`

Diagnose Scopus connectivity and entitlement. Checks config presence, api.elsevier.com reachability, metadata and search entitlement, and per-API capabilities (REF-view references, ScienceDirect full text, Serial Title journal metrics). Returns a JSON report with a one-line verdict and 'unavailable_tools', the tools that cannot work with the current access. Run this first when Scopus behaves strangely — especially when valid searches fail with 'Error translating query', which usually means missing subscriber entitlement (off-network without SCOPUS_INSTTOKEN), not bad query syntax.

### `get_quota_status`

Get the current API quota status (remaining/limit). Note: Values are updated only after making a request.

### `get_server_info`

Return the server version and a health summary. Call this to confirm which build you are talking to.

### `job_status`

State of a background job started by a long tool call (citation_network, resolve_citers, ...) that passed the sync budget: running, finished or failed, and its last step.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `job_id` | string | required |  |

### `job_result`

Output of a finished background job (its status if still running).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `job_id` | string | required |  |
