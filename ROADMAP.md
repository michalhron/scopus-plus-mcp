# Scopus MCP — Roadmap

Single living plan for the `michalhron/scopus-mcp` fork. Replaces the
2026-06-24 roadmap and the 2026-06-25 addendum; their research-design content
is kept verbatim under "Research design" below.

_Last updated: 2026-09-30._

## Status

- 0.10.0: Phase 1 complete; one-click installs for Claude Desktop (.mcpb
  extension) and Claude Code (plugin). See CHANGELOG.md.
- 18 tools. Scopus: search, `search_all`, abstracts, author search and profiles,
  identifiers, references, citing papers, full text. Networks:
  `bibliographic_coupling`, `co_citation`, `citation_lineage` with SPC main
  path. Bibliometrics: `publication_counts`, `get_journal_metrics`,
  `get_bibtex`. Ops: `diagnose_connection`, quota, server info. Search,
  citations, references, networks and counts also run on OpenAlex.
- 167 offline test functions (369 cases); CI on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows.
- Upstream (qwe4559999/scopus-mcp) inactive since 2026-05-17; PRs #11–#14
  unanswered. This fork is maintained independently.

## Phase 0 — Close out

- [x] Off-network entitlement: OS secret store, proxy, diagnostics (0.8.1).
- [x] Cross-OS CI.
- [x] CHANGELOG.md; this consolidated roadmap.
- [x] Merge PR #2 into `main` (2026-09-30). Claude may not merge PRs;
      Michal merges.
- [ ] Optional: comment on upstream PRs asking about co-maintainership.

## Phase 1 — Features

Every new tool gets a live smoke test before it is trusted (see Lessons).

1. [x] **Per-API access check.** `diagnose_connection` probes REF view,
       ScienceDirect full text and Serial Title, and lists unavailable tools.
       Live on campus 2026-09-30: all three entitled (REF returned 109 refs;
       subscription full text 53,017 chars). So the June REF refusal was not a
       permanent key limit; most likely it happened off the campus network.
2. [ ] **Re-run earlier Scopus coupling networks.** Networks built before the
       2026-09-30 reference-paging fix used at most 40 references per seed.
       Data work, not code.
3. [x] **OpenAlex backend.** `source="openalex"` on search, citing papers,
       references, coupling and co-citation; results carry OpenAlex IDs and
       sources are never mixed. Live 2026-09-30 on four organizing-vision
       seeds: Scopus coupling 4/4 seeds, 6 edges; OpenAlex 1/4. Two AIS
       eLibrary papers are in OpenAlex with no reference lists (and
       misattributed to JAIS), one ICIS paper has no exact title match.
       Journal articles work, but thinner (Swanson 2025: 132 references in
       OpenAlex vs 171 in Scopus). `citation_lineage` too: live forward
       walk of Swanson & Ramiller 1997 (2 gens, 20 per node, min 50 cites):
       Scopus 378 papers, OpenAlex 348, different main paths.
4. [x] **Yearly publication counts.** `publication_counts`, both sources.
       Live 2015–2026 for "organizing vision": Scopus 61, OpenAlex 77, with
       different year profiles, so compare trends within one source only.
5. [x] **Journal metrics.** `get_journal_metrics`. Two live traps: Serial
       Title ignores Scopus source IDs (returns the first 25 journals
       alphabetically, HTTP 200), and knows JIT only as 2251-919X/1466-4437,
       not the 0268-3962 its search records carry. Source IDs are mapped via
       SRCID search and matched by source ID. Basket of Eight live: 7/8 by
       print ISSN, JIT via source ID. The litbaskets skill can pass SRCIDs.
6. [x] **BibTeX export.** `get_bibtex`; publisher metadata via DOI content
       negotiation (errors included: Crossref spells Doreian "Dereian" for
       Hummon & Doreian 1989), generated entries for DOI-less AIS papers.
7. [x] **Author search by name.** `search_authors`, Scopus and OpenAlex.
       Live: Scopus finds E. Burton Swanson (94 documents, UCLA) plus a split
       one-document profile; OpenAlex ranks him first by full name but cannot
       filter by institution, so affiliation filtering covers its top 25.

## Phase 2 — Public release (only if outside users are wanted)

- [x] Package name: `citation-network-mcp`; repository renamed to match
      (2026-09-30). Authors, URLs and `mcp-name` updated; MIT kept, upstream
      credited.
- [ ] Detach the repository from upstream's fork network (GitHub settings,
      Michal).
- [x] PyPI trusted publisher configured; v0.11.0 tagged (2026-09-30).
- [x] `publish.yml` publishes to PyPI (trusted publishing) and the MCP
      registry on version tags, under the new name.
- [x] Split `server.py` into `scopus_mcp/tools/` modules by group (0.14.0).
- [x] Split `utils.py` into `records`, `graphs`, `lineage`, `output` and
      `oa_fulltext` modules; `utils.py` re-exports for older imports.
- [x] README around the differentiator (done 2026-09-30, ahead of Phase 2).
- [x] Dropped README_CN and the Chinese prompt guide; English examples in
      `docs/examples.md`.
- [x] Claude Desktop extension and Claude Code plugin (0.10.0).
- [x] First PyPI and MCP registry release: citation-network-mcp 0.11.0
      (2026-09-30); install instructions and the Claude Code plugin use
      `uvx citation-network-mcp`.

## Phase 1b — Review scoping and full text (0.12.0, 2026-09-30)

- [x] `search_fulltext`: ScienceDirect full-text search with mention
      analysis (body vs reference list, positions, sentences).
- [x] Category percentiles in `get_journal_metrics`; `find_journals` for
      percentile cut-offs; `topic_landscape` for where and at what quartile a
      topic is published. Live, "organizing vision": 140 papers, Information
      Systems 37 (30 in Q1), 46% in unranked venues (AMCIS/ICIS proceedings).

- [x] Venue types in `topic_landscape` (0.13.0): quartiles count journals
      only by default. Live, manufacturing-as-a-service: 35% of papers are
      journal articles, 43% conference proceedings, 18% book series; Control
      and Systems Engineering went from 18% Q1 (all ranked venues) to 64% Q1
      (journals only, 37 papers in proceedings and book series).

## Rename to scopus-plus-mcp (0.16.0, 2026-09-30)

- [x] Repository, package, extension, plugin and registry entry renamed;
      `citation-network-mcp` and `scopus-mcp` commands kept as aliases.
- [x] PyPI pending publisher for `scopus-plus-mcp` (Michal), then tag v0.16.0.
- [x] Switch Claude Desktop to `uvx scopus-plus-mcp@latest` after release.

## Network audit (0.17.0, 2026-09-30)

From a full organizing-vision network build (105 papers, Basket of Eight),
run from a cloud session.

- [x] `get_references` states returned/available/truncated; `filter_ids`;
      Crossref completeness check.
- [x] "Error translating query": a known-good query decides between a bad
      query and missing entitlement; field-restriction errors get their own note.
- [x] `search_all` `inline='compact'|'full'` for callers without file access;
      `scope` (ISSN list or `basket_of_eight`) on `search_all` and
      `citation_lineage`.
- [x] `citation_network`: within-set network, main path, key routes,
      completeness flags, Pajek export (one call instead of 105).
- [x] `resolve_citers`: several strategies merged and verified against
      each hit's reference list.
- [x] `citation_context`: Semantic Scholar contexts, intents, influence.
- [x] Citation cycles broken against publication order (earliest known
      date) instead of silently dropping papers from the main path.
- [ ] OpenCitations as a third reference count / edge cross-check.
- [x] Retraction flags (Crossref's Retraction Watch data; 0.24.0 `check_retractions`, on by default in citation_network).
- [ ] Zotero: push a corpus into a collection (needs the user's Zotero key).
- [x] Contexts for every edge of a `citation_network` (0.24.0 `edge_contexts`, draft labels and a coding sheet; about 3 s per edge without a Semantic Scholar key).
- [ ] Emit ISSN clauses in the litbaskets skill (skill-side, not in this repo).

## Field-test fixes (0.17.1, 2026-09-30)

- [x] P0 crash on list-valued DOIs; per-paper error isolation.
- [x] P1 rate limits, REF-view last reference (FULL-view recovery),
      completeness fallbacks, cross-index citers, S2 resolution routes.
- [x] P2 background jobs, inline nodes/paged full, key-route wording,
      context cleaning, per-strategy table, duplicates.
- [x] 0.18.0: context fallback from full text; `path_transmission`;
      `index_coverage`; coding-sheet export.
- [ ] Contexts from AIS eLibrary full text (403 to automated downloads;
      needs a sanctioned route, e.g. user-supplied PDFs).
- [x] Kappa helper for the filled coding sheet (0.24.0 `coding_agreement`; also scores the draft labels against the coders).

## From established bibliometrics tools (planned 2026-09-30)

Chosen from bibliometrix, metaknowledge, Pajek/MainPath and CitNetExplorer
for construct-lineage work (main paths, the transmission audit). Items 1–4
make one release that strengthens a methods section; 5–6 follow.

- [x] **1. Main-path variants** (Pajek, MainPath; 0.19.0). SPLC and SPNP
      beside SPC; local forward, local backward and global searches;
      local and global key routes; robustness of the global path across
      the three weights. Organizing-vision network: the global path is the
      same under all three; the local backward path leaves it after Wang
      2010 (Nielsen 2014, Gal 2022).
- [x] **2. Thematic evolution** (bibliometrix; 0.21.0 `thematic_evolution`).
      Keyword co-occurrence themes per period in the strategic diagram,
      flows between periods, and a followed construct. Organizing vision
      (author keywords, cuts 2005 and 2013): a basic theme with IS/IT
      innovation, then an emerging-or-declining theme with discourse and
      ERP while management fashion is a motor theme, then a motor theme with
      innovation and diffusion beside a new digital-transformation theme.
- [x] **3. Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy** (metaknowledge,
      bibliometrix; 0.20.0 `rpys`). Organizing-vision citers: peaks at 1983
      (DiMaggio & Powell), 1991 (Abrahamson; Powell & DiMaggio), 1994
      (Swanson; King et al.), 1997 (Swanson & Ramiller), 2004 (Swanson &
      Ramiller), 2007 (institutional logics).
- [x] **4. Historiograph** (Garfield; bibliometrix; 0.20.0 `historiograph`).
      8 of the 10 main-path papers are among the 25 most cited within the
      set; Ramiller 2008 and Wang 2021 only just.
- [x] **5. Research fronts** (CitNetExplorer; 0.22.0 `research_fronts`).
      Louvain communities of the direct-citation network, labelled by
      distinctive keywords, and the main path's route across them with hop
      robustness over three resolutions. Organizing vision: the path runs
      through an organizing-vision/institutional-entrepreneurship front
      (Ramiller 2003), a management-fashion front (Swanson 2004 to Wang
      2010), a digital-innovation front (Kohli 2019, Wang 2021) and an
      innovation/diffusion/frames front; the Wang 2010 to Kohli 2019 hop is
      the edge path_transmission labels hollow.
- [x] **6. Import of Scopus / Web of Science export files** (bibliometrix,
      metaknowledge; 0.23.0 `import_records`). Scopus CSV/RIS/BibTeX and
      WoS plain text/tab-delimited, deduplicated across files, WoS records
      matched to Scopus by DOI then title and year; the corpus file feeds
      every corpus tool (`corpus_file`), and thematic_evolution runs on it
      without API calls.

All six items done (0.19.0 to 0.23.0).

Deliberately left out: Lotka and Bradford laws (find_journals and
topic_landscape cover venue quality), a point-and-click interface (the
conversation is the interface), topic modelling (Claude reading abstracts
does it more transparently), active-learning screening (ASReview's job),
co-authorship and country networks and altmetrics (not lineage questions).

## Phase 3 — Research pipeline

Orchestrator skill (Session D below) and the lineage-model ideas. Mostly
skill-side, so independent of distribution.

## OpenAlex-only operation (planned 2026-10-11)

Goal: every tool that can run on OpenAlex does, and the server works when
Scopus is down or not subscribed. Audit of the 36 tools (code reading only,
checked at the entry points; not yet run): 21 work on OpenAlex, 5 partly, 10
are Scopus-only. Order is by how much each unblocks.

**A. Startup blocker (do first; nothing else matters until this lands)**
- [x] (2026-10-11) Start without a Scopus key. `server.py` builds `ScopusClient()` at
      import and `client.py` raises on a missing key, so even the 21 tools
      that never call Scopus are unreachable. Make the Scopus client lazy or
      optional; Scopus tools then fail with one clear message naming
      `set-key api_key`. The test fixtures set a dummy key to get around this.
- [x] Test: `tests/test_client_no_key.py`, `test_server_imports_without_a_scopus_key`,
      and `scripts/smoke_openalex_only.py`, which calls every tool live with no
      Scopus key. Result 2026-10-11: 21 of 29 calls ok; `search_scopus`,
      `search_fulltext`, `get_abstract_details`, `resolve_identifier`,
      `get_author_profile`, `index_coverage`, `topic_landscape` and
      `find_journals` fail with the missing-key message (sections B and C below).
- [x] `docs/configuration.md`: `SCOPUS_API_KEY` is needed for Scopus tools only.

**B. Tools with no OpenAlex branch**
- [ ] `get_abstract_details`, `resolve_identifier`: resolve DOIs and `W...` IDs
      through OpenAlex (`get_work`); keep Scopus IDs on Scopus.
- [ ] `get_author_profile`: OpenAlex author lookup (the OpenAlex branch of
      `search_authors` exists).
- [ ] `topic_landscape`: Scopus facets today; build the equivalent from
      OpenAlex `group_by` (topics, fields). `topic_profile` already does most
      of it.
- [ ] `find_journals`: CiteScore percentiles have no OpenAlex equivalent. Offer
      an OpenAlex ranking by 2-year mean citedness, labelled as not
      field-relative, or refuse with a message that says so.
- [ ] `search_fulltext`: ScienceDirect only. Refuse cleanly under OpenAlex
      (the open-access full-text lookup in `get_fulltext` already works).
- [ ] `index_coverage`: the Scopus REF side is unguarded, so a Scopus error
      aborts the whole call. Return the OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar sets and
      mark the Scopus column unavailable.
- [ ] `diagnose_connection`, `get_quota_status`: report OpenAlex too (key
      source, daily budget from the `x-ratelimit-*` headers). Key source is
      done; budget is not.

**C. Partial tools**
- [ ] `import_records`: `resolve` defaults to Scopus and aborts on error. Fall
      back to DOI matching and OpenAlex when Scopus is unavailable.
- [ ] `get_bibtex`, `citation_context`, `path_transmission`, `check_retractions`:
      Scopus-ID inputs still call Scopus. Resolve Scopus IDs to DOIs once,
      cache the mapping, and skip a Scopus-ID input with a per-item message
      when Scopus is down. Add a `source` parameter to the first three.
- [ ] `get_references`, `get_citing_papers`, `citation_network`: a Scopus ID
      input is first resolved to a DOI through Scopus. Same fix.

**D. Consistency**
- [ ] Tools without a `source` field silently ignore `source='openalex'`
      (`search_scopus`, `topic_landscape`, `index_coverage`, ...). Return an
      explicit error, as `topic_profile` does.
- [ ] One table in `docs/data-sources.md`: tool by source, what differs
      (author affiliation filter is post-hoc on the top 25 name matches;
      `citation_lineage` refuses `sort='relevancy'`; `get_journal_metrics`
      takes ISSNs only).

**E. From the live check of the topics work (2026-10-11)**
- [ ] Live check of `--lanes-by-field`, the OR-cap chunking, `topic_match` and
      `work_types`.
- [ ] Live check of the year and month split of the quality cut once the
      OpenAlex budget allows (anonymous: $0.10 per day; a free key raises it).
- [ ] Budget guard: before a split that needs more than N requests, report the
      estimate and the remaining daily budget instead of running into a 429.
- [ ] `set-key` for the Windows and Linux stores has no test on those
      platforms; CI only covers the argument handling.

## Release process

Change `__version__` in `src/scopus_mcp/__init__.py` (the only place the
version lives), run `scripts/build_extension.py` to sync the extension and
plugin manifests, move the CHANGELOG's Unreleased entries under the new
version, and merge to `main`. Then push the tag `vX.Y.Z`: `release.yml`
checks it matches the version and publishes a GitHub Release with the
`.mcpb` attached.

# Research design

Carried over verbatim from the 2026-06-24 roadmap and 2026-06-25 addendum.

### Known boundaries (facts, not bugs)

- REF-VIEW ENTITLEMENT WALL. The current API key (individual entitlement) is
  refused on Abstract Retrieval view=REF: X-ELS-Status=AUTHORIZATION_ERROR with
  X-RateLimit-Remaining=9983 (NOT quota exhaustion; key works for all non-REF
  endpoints). This blocks get_references, bibliographic_coupling, and BACKWARD
  citation_lineage. Forward lineage (via search_all citing queries) is unaffected
  and is the usable capability now.
  UNRESOLVED CONTRADICTION: get_references worked earlier on 2026-06-24 (Swanson
  85216793920 returned 40 refs; coupling processed 13/14 seeds), then refused
  later the same session. Either intermittent, or a per-document/rate dimension.
  RETEST one clean get_references on 85216793920 when the API is fresh: 40 refs
  (transient blip) vs AUTHORIZATION_ERROR (truly token-gated).

- INSTTOKEN IS THE SINGLE UNLOCK. The institutional token (requested from Elsevier
  2026-06-24, apisupport@elsevier.com, from UGent address, with the API key)
  unlocks BOTH REF view AND ScienceDirect full text — they are coupled. When it
  arrives: add "SCOPUS_INSTTOKEN":"..." to the config env block, repin, no code
  change. As of 2026-06-25 AM: no reply yet. Everything in section 2 is gated on
  this.

- FULL TEXT ALREADY PARTLY WORKS. get_fulltext returned sciencedirect-fulltext
  (154,448 chars) on 10.1016/j.infoandorg.2026.100608 WITHOUT the insttoken —
  Elsevier entitlements are granular/per-endpoint, so the full-text path shows
  life even before the token. Provenance flagging (sciencedirect-fulltext /
  oa-fulltext / scopus-abstract / none) is the methodological backbone: the audit
  must never present an abstract-grade verdict as full-text-grade.

- RECENCY FLOOR. Ahead-of-print 2026 papers are not yet Scopus-indexed and cannot
  be seeds (e.g. Leavell ISR 10.1287/isre.2024.1339, published online 2026-06-12,
  returned "no record"). OpenAlex/Crossref index faster — folding them in would
  raise the recency floor (future triangulation work).

### Lessons (the recurring tax)

Three times now, Claude Code's mocked tests passed while the live Scopus
contract failed: (1) cursor paging cap, (2) the 1 MB tool-return limit,
(3) the REF parser. Mocked tests prove *logic*; only a live call proves the
*shape*. **Rule: every new tool gets a live smoke test before we trust it.**

The REF parser bug specifically: real REF view uses FLAT keys
(`scopus-id`, `ce:doi`, `title`, `sourcetitle`, `prism:coverDate`,
`author-list.author[].ce:indexed-name`, dedup by `@auid`), NOT the nested
`ref-info`/`refd-itemidlist` structure originally assumed. The 0.5.1 test now
asserts a parsed ref has `scopus_id` or `doi`, so this can't regress silently.

### Cross-source principle: Scopus = structure, Springer = content

`resolve_identifier` -> DOI -> SpringerLink (`get_article`,
`get_open_access_fulltext`). Scopus knows the citation graph; Springer knows
what papers *say* (real abstracts, OA full text). Citation tracing has never
seen inside the papers — this pairing does.

**Coverage caveat that shapes which ideas are real:** Springer's IS footprint is
partial. Basket of Eight is mostly INFORMS/Wiley/T&F, not Springer — for
MISQ/ISR, fall back to Scopus abstracts or triangulate via OpenAlex/Crossref.
Springer lands well on BISE, Electronic Markets, IS Frontiers, and the
LNCS/LNBIP conference world (e.g. the PoEM paper, the DPP papers in Electronic
Markets). Full-text-dependent ideas work best on the design-science / Euro-IS /
conference slice and degrade gracefully elsewhere.

#### Ideas on top of the foundation

- **Annotated network maps.** Name coupling/co-citation clusters by their shared
  Springer abstract content, not raw keywords.
- **Citation-context / predicate test.** With OA full text, check whether a
  citing paper engages the seed construct substantively (load-bearing in the
  theory section) or just name-drops it. Scopus says "X cited Y"; Springer text
  says *how* — real inheritance vs. ritual citation.
- **Bridge-paper reading pipeline.** Map network (Scopus) -> high-betweenness
  papers -> full text (Springer) for just those -> summarize. Read 8 pivotal
  papers, not 200 abstracts.

### How this feeds `mechanism-inheritance-audit` (the convergence point)

Today the audit runs on the handful of papers Michal has personally read. The
pipeline makes it corpus-scale and empirical:

1. **Seed** a paper or construct (organizing vision, swift trust).
2. **`search_all`** the forward-citation lineage across generations (no 25-cap).
3. **`resolve_identifier`** each citing paper -> DOI.
4. **SpringerLink** pull abstracts / OA full text per citing cohort.
5. **Feed the text** into the inheritance classifier to judge
   *survives / reinterprets / breaks* per cohort — on content, not titles.
6. **Predicate test** uses OA full text to confirm the mechanism's predicates
   actually survive in the citing work, not just the label.

Scopus supplies the lineage skeleton; Springer supplies the flesh. The
difference between an anecdote and a corpus-scale finding for **"What Inherits?
A Forcing Audit for the IS Cumulative Tradition"** (CAIS Debate, Sept 2026).

### The reframe: this is an AUDIT layer on an established method, not a new method

The structural machinery built so far — forward lineage walking, SPC main-path
scoring, the layered DAG, the D3/PNG renderers — is NOT the contribution. It is a
reimplementation of an established, decades-old, citable method: main-path
analysis (Hummon & Doreian 1989; Batagelj 2003), already implemented in Pajek and
already applied within IS (Liang et al. 2016, IT outsourcing, Information &
Management). The map this produces is a solved problem.

The contribution is the layer ON TOP: a substrate/predicate audit that reads the
full text at each transmission edge and judges whether the mechanism actually
survived, was reinterpreted, or broke. Every main-path method in the literature
assumes citation == knowledge transmission. None reads the text to test that
assumption. That untested assumption is the blind spot; the audit fills it.

Paper structure that follows from this:
- Section 3 (baseline / method built upon): the SPC main-path machinery. Cite
  Hummon-Doreian, Batagelj, Pajek, Liang et al. This is DONE in code.
- Section 4 (contribution): the substrate/predicate audit. Survives / reinterprets
  / breaks, read from full text. This is SPEC'd, not built (gated on insttoken).

Key rhetorical move: reproduce a Liang-style main-path trajectory on the seed,
then show — by reading each edge — that some transmissions are real inheritance
and others ceremonial, and that this changes the trajectory. The before/after
figure (raw map vs. verdict-coloured map) is the key figure.

Target paper: "What Inherits? A Forcing Audit for the IS Cumulative Tradition"
(CAIS Debate, Sept 2026).

### Four lineage-model design ideas (all gated on REF + full text)

These emerged in sequence and compose into one model. The tree rendered on
2026-06-24 is the single-parent SIMPLIFICATION of this target model.

(a) TRANSMISSION-BASED PARENTAGE. Do not parent every citer to the seed. Parent
    each paper to the most recent lineage member it ALSO cites — that is where it
    actually inherited the construct; the seed citation is often ceremonial.
    Requires each node's reference list (REF view).

(b) CITATION INTENSITY AS EDGE WEIGHT. Count in-text mentions of each cited
    lineage member in the body. One parenthetical mention in the intro = likely
    performative; repeated engagement across sections = real inheritance. A
    structural (countable) signal that needs full text but not judgment. Fiddly:
    must handle author-year and numeric citation forms, disambiguate same-author
    papers. NOTE: nearest prior work is Liu et al. 2014 ("citations with
    different levels of relevancy") — read it to carve the delta.

(c) MULTIPLE PARENTS (the DAG, not the tree). Retrospectives / "25 years on"
    papers engage the whole history including the root — they don't branch at the
    end, they wire to many ancestors at once. A paper is a child of EVERY lineage
    member it substantively engages, weighted by intensity. Generation becomes a
    property of the EDGE (this edge spans N generations), not of the paper. Node
    parentage shape then classifies paper type for free: many-generation parents
    = synthesiser/retrospective; one strong recent parent = thread-continuer;
    weak seed-only edge = performative citer.

(d) PERFORMATIVE-CITATION FLAGGING. A late, low-intensity, seed-only citation is
    ceremonial, not inheritance. Time-lag (citer year − seed year), especially
    relative to the construct's canonisation point, is a cheap STRUCTURAL PRIOR
    for which edges to suspect. Lag tells you where to look; the text tells you
    what's there. Prior, never verdict. NOTE: nearest prior work is Liu & Kuan
    2016 ("decay in knowledge diffusion") — read it to carve the delta.

Discipline held throughout: SERVER = structure/data (deterministic, no LLM).
SKILL = judgment (the survives/reinterprets/breaks classifier). Structure prunes
(main-path / lag / parentage / intensity); the classifier judges only the spine.

### Related work to map (the foil literature)

The contribution is positioned AGAINST this literature, which is the foundation
and the foil — not competition. Read the two starred ones FIRST; they are nearest
the contribution and define the delta.

Foundational / method:
- Hummon & Doreian (1989), Social Networks 11(1):39-63 — 10.1016/0378-8733(89)90017-8 — the origin (SPC method rebuilt on 06-24).
- Batagelj (2003), arXiv cs/0309023 — the SPC algorithm specifically.
- Liu & Lu (2012), JASIST 63(3):528-542 — 10.1002/asi.21692 — key-route search (multiple main paths; relevant to DAG-not-tree).
- Liu, Lu & Ho (2019), Scientometrics 119(1):379-391 — 10.1007/s11192-019-03034-x — "a few notes on main path analysis"; where the method is contested.

NEAREST PRIOR WORK — READ FIRST:
- * Liu, Chen, Ho & Li (2014), JASIST 65(12):2479-2488 — 10.1002/asi.23135 — "citations with different levels of relevancy." Nearest to the CITATION-INTENSITY idea. Confirm: they weight structurally/by metadata; the audit weights by READING.
- * Liu & Kuan (2016), JASIST 67(2):465-476 — 10.1002/asi.23384 — "decay in knowledge diffusion." Nearest to the PERFORMATIVE-CITATION idea. Confirm: their decay is structural; the audit's is text-confirmed.

IS precedent (proves the method is accepted in-field; also the visual foil):
- Liang, Wang, Xue & Cui (2016), Information & Management 53(2):227-251 — 10.1016/j.im.2015.10.001 — main-path analysis of IT outsourcing. Figure 5 ("multiple main paths of the ITO citation network") is the canonical example of what the structural method produces — and what it cannot show (whether any edge is real inheritance). Use as the motivating foil figure.

Also useful:

STILL TO SEARCH (not yet mapped): citation-context classification / "citation
function" NLP literature — the subfield that classifies WHY a paper cites another.
Nearest to the intensity/engagement idea on the NLP side; map before claiming
novelty there. (Not searched as of 06-25.)

Tooling note: Pajek is the canonical main-path tool but is a GUI desktop app — not
a library, no API to attach edge verdicts. Cite it as the established tool; do NOT
try to integrate it. Use it once at most to validate that compute_main_path
reproduces the canonical SPC numbers.

### SESSION D — orchestrator skill prompt (ready to paste into Claude Code)

> Note: build the lineage-walker tool (multi-generation forward traversal) as
> part of this, OR as a small Session A.5 first — the orchestrator needs it.
> The current `get_citing_papers` / `search_all` are single-hop only.

I want to build a cross-source bibliometric orchestrator as a SKILL (not server
code), in my skills directory, that chains my Scopus MCP server and my
SpringerLink MCP server to run mechanism-inheritance audits at corpus scale.
Read my existing `mechanism-inheritance-audit` skill first to match its
structure, vocabulary (survives / reinterprets / breaks, predicate test,
forcing analogy), and output format — this skill orchestrates data collection
and hands the assembled corpus to that existing classifier; it does not
reimplement the judgment.

The skill's pipeline, given a seed paper (Scopus ID or DOI) and a construct name:

1. Resolve the seed via `resolve_identifier` to get its DOI and metadata.
2. Walk the forward-citation lineage with `search_all` on `REF(2-s2.0-<id>)`.
   Support N generations (default 1, optional 2): generation 1 = direct citers;
   generation 2 = citers of those, deduped against generation 1. Tag every
   citing paper with its generation, year, and venue. Cap per generation to
   bound quota (default 300).
3. For each citing paper, resolve its DOI.
4. For papers whose DOI is in Springer's coverage, pull the abstract via the
   SpringerLink MCP (`get_article`), and OA full text via
   `get_open_access_fulltext` where available. For non-Springer DOIs, fall back
   to the Scopus abstract. Record provenance (springer-fulltext /
   springer-abstract / scopus-abstract / none) per paper.
5. Group citing papers into cohorts by generation x (year band or venue tier).
6. Assemble a corpus file (reuse the Scopus file-output convention:
   `SCOPUS_MCP_OUTPUT_DIR`, JSON) with one record per citing paper:
   scopus_id, doi, title, year, venue, generation, provenance, abstract/text.
7. Hand each cohort's text to the `mechanism-inheritance-audit` classifier to
   judge survives / reinterprets / breaks for the named construct, and where OA
   full text exists, run the predicate test (does the citing paper engage the
   construct substantively or name-drop it).
8. Return: a cohort-by-cohort inheritance table (generation, cohort, verdict,
   evidence-strength flag based on provenance), the corpus file path, and a list
   of the highest-leverage papers (full-text-available + high citation) to read.

Be explicit about the coverage caveat: Springer IS coverage is partial, so most
verdicts on Basket-of-Eight-heavy lineages will rest on abstracts, not full
text — flag evidence strength accordingly and never present an abstract-only
verdict as if it had full-text backing.

This is a design-and-scaffold task; don't run the full pipeline live yet — build
the skill, stub the tool calls with the real signatures, and give me a dry-run
plan on the organizing-vision seed before we spend quota on a real corpus.
